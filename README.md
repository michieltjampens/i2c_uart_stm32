# I2C to USART with stm32
Firmware for STM32C0 with CORE M0+ to use the usarts via i2c. 
Because I wanted a cheaper alternative to the purpose built chips that start at 6€.

## Info
- Starting with the [STM32C011F4U6TR](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32c011f4.html).
 - Program memory: 16kB
 - Ram memory: 6kB
 - I2C: 1x FM+
 - USART x2
 - Costs about 1,2€ ex vat
- Code will not use LL or HAL.
